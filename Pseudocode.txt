1. Read scene description and camera location from file.
2. Render scene.
3. Save to file.
4. Display image from file.

2. For y in range(res_y):
		for x in range(res_x):
			create vector v from camera to canvas[y][x]
			find closest collision point p of v and objects
			compute color c at p
			image[y][x] = c
