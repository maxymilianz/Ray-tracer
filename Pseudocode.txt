1. Read scene description and camera location from file.
2. Render scene.
3. Save to file.
4. Display image from file.

2. For y in range(res_y):
		for x in range(res_x):
			1. create vector v from camera to canvas[y][x]
			2. find closest collision point p of v and objects
			3. compute color c at p
			4. image[y][x] = c
			
x grows to right, y - down, z - further from camera
